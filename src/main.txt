Fonts:

Main Font (Body Text):
Sans-Serif with a Modern Feel:
Inter (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) is a clean and legible sans-serif font with a slightly geometric touch.
Open Sans (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) is another great option with a neutral style that won't overpower the visual elements.
Classic Monospace (Optional):
Fira Mono (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono) offers a unique, typewriter-inspired look that can add a touch of retro charm. However, limit its use for short text snippets or code elements due to readability concerns.
Heading Font (Titles, Section Headers):

Display Font with Neon Flair:
Miami Vice (https://fonts.google.com/) perfectly captures the synthwave vibe with its bold, 80s-inspired design. Use sparingly for maximum impact.
Rad Retro (https://www.1001fonts.com/google-web+retro-fonts.html) is another option with a chunky, retro feel.
Sans-Serif with Bold Weight:
You can use a bolder version of your main font for headings to create contrast and hierarchy.
Here are some additional tips for choosing fonts:

Font Pairing: Choose two fonts that complement each other. A clean sans-serif for body text and a bolder display font for headings will ensure readability and visual interest.
Legibility: Prioritize fonts that are easy to read on screens, especially for body text.
Limited Fonts: Stick to 2-3 fonts to maintain a cohesive look and avoid overwhelming visitors.
Here's an example font combination:

Main Font: Inter (Sans-serif)
Heading Font: Miami Vice (Display)
This combination offers a clean and modern base with the Miami Vice font adding a touch of neon flair to the headings.
